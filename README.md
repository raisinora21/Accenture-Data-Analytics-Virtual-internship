# Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Virtual-Internship.
In the program, I am working as a Data Analyst at Accenture.
Our Data analytics team has been assigned a new project for a client called Social Buzz. One of Accentureâ€™s Managing Directors, Mae Mulligan, is the client lead for Social Buzz. At the end she needs to be updated with project details. 
# Client Background:
Client name: Social Buzz
Client industry: Social media & content creation
Year established: 2010
Location of HQ: San Francisco
Number of employees: 250
Social Buzz was founded by two former engineers from a large social media conglomerate, one from London and the other from San Francisco. They left in 2008 and both met in San Francisco to start their business. They started Social Buzz because they saw an opportunity to build on the foundation that their previous company started by creating a new platform where content took center stage. Social Buzz emphasizes content by keeping all users anonymous, only tracking user reactions on every piece of content. There are over 100 ways that users can react to content, spanning beyond the traditional reactions of likes, dislikes, and comments. This ensures that trending content, as opposed to individual users, is at the forefront of user feeds

#Task: 
1. to highlight the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity and to present the insights in the form of presentation for the stakeholders to understand.
2. How many unique categories are there?
3. How many reactions are there to the most popular category?
4. What was the month with the most posts?

#Steps involves:
1. Data understanding
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data Modelling
4. Data Analysis
5. Data visualisation.
